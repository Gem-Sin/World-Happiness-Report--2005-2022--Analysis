# World-Happiness-Report--2005-2022--Analysis
A Python project analysing the [World Happiness Report (2005-2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabinnepal/world-happiness-dataset-2005-to-2023) 
## Project Summary

This project explores the World Happiness Report (2005–2022) dataset to uncover trends and relationships between happiness and socio-economic factors. The aim is to create interactive Tableau dashboards that provide actionable insights for data-driven storytelling.

The analysis focused on:

- Understanding the relationship between GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy and happiness.

- Identifying patterns across different countries and regions.

- Building an interactive dashboard to communicate findings visually.

---

## Key Questions

- Which countries report the highest and lowest happiness scores over time?

- How do GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy correlate with happiness?

- What regional trends exist, and how do they compare across continents?

---
